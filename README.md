[This notebook](corpus-driven-narrative-generation.ipynb) is intended to show a
few ways that you can go about creating new narratives from an existing corpus
of narrative text using Python and a few readily-available Python libraries. It
was created as tutorial for [Computational Approaches to
Narrative](http://catn.decontextualize.com/), a class I teach at
[ITP](http://itp.nyu.edu/).
