    "## Foreword\n",
    "The War Machine is a brain-blending journey into the depths of a computer-generated war narrative. Not conventionally coherent, this ironic nightmare of a war-story is true to reality like no other. As cryptic as a homeless veteran on the train, The War Machine speaks in the insane voice of war trauma. \n",
    "Trained on a corpus of dozens of war novels, seasoned with handpicked related literature,  The War Machine is a disturbingly violent text. Elusive, confusing and perverted, this computer-generated prose might not tell a kind of story a human strain of thought can follow. Nonetheless, it does a pretty good job of portraying a realistic state of the world, fractured by wars. Because In the end of the day, who’s more trained than than the machine itself to write war novels?\n",

    "# A few simple corpus-driven approaches to narrative analysis and generation\n",
    "\n",
    "By [Allison Parrish](http://www.decontextualize.com/)\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is a fast introduction to a few techniques for working with narrative corpora. By \"narrative corpora,\" I mean pre-existing bodies of text that mostly contain the texts of narratives. In particular, we're going to use Mark Riedl's [WikiPlots corpus](https://github.com/markriedl/WikiPlots), which has the titles and plot summaries of more than one hundred thousand movies, books, television shows and other media from Wikipedia.\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook takes you through using [spaCy](http://spacy.io) to extract words, noun chunks, parts of speech and entities from the text and then sew them back together with [Tracery](http://tracery.io). It then shows how to use [Markovify](https://github.com/jsvine/markovify) to create new narratives from existing narrative text, along with a quick example of recurrent neural network text generation with [textgenrnn](https://github.com/minimaxir/textgenrnn).\n",
    "\n",
    "The code is written in Python, but you don't really need to know Python in order to use the notebook. Everything's pre-written for you, so you can just execute the cells, making small changes to the code as needed. Even if the notebook itself doesn't end up being useful to you, hopefully it spurs a few ideas that you can take with you into your practice as a storyteller and/or programmer."

    "## Loading the corpus\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step is to get the narrative corpus into the program. Because WikiPlots is so big, we're actually going to be working with a smaller subset: only the plot summaries for romantic comedy movies. The subcorpus was made using [this notebook on creating a subcorpus of WikiPlots](https://github.com/aparrish/corpus-driven-narrative-generation/blob/master/creating-a-wikiplots-subcorpus.ipynb), which you can consult if you want to make your own with a different subset of WikiPlots.\n",
    "\n",
    "The corpus we're working with takes the form of a TSV file (\"tab separated values\"), with each line containing the title of the movie, a number indicating where in the plot summary the sentence for this line occurs, the total number of sentences in the summary, and the actual text of the sentence. The following cell loads the data into a list of dictionaries:"

Markov chain text generation has been a pastime of poets and programmers going back [all the way to 1983](https://www.jstor.org/stable/24969024), so it should be no surprise that there are many implementations of the idea in Python that you can download and install. The one we're going to use is [Markovify](https://github.com/jsvine/markovify), a Markov chain text generation library originally developed for BuzzFeed, apparently. Writing [code to implement a Markov chain generator](https://github.com/aparrish/rwet/blob/master/ngrams-and-markov-chains.ipynb) on your own is certainly possible, but Markovify comes with a lot of extra niceties that will make our lives easier."
