    "# Creating a WikiPlots subcorpus\n",

    "By [Allison Parrish](https://github.com/markriedl/WikiPlots)\n",
    "\n",
    "Mark Riedl's [WikiPlots corpus](https://github.com/markriedl/WikiPlots) has the titles and plot summaries of more than one hundred thousand movies, books, television shows and other media from Wikipedia. That's a lot! This notebook has some sample code to trim it down a little bit. In particular, it shows how to get just a list of plots for Romantic Comedies.\n",

    "## Wikidata\n",
    "\n",
    "[Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Main_Page) is a collection of structured data that (among other things) provides a formal canonical interface to metadata for Wikipedia articles. It has a [query service](https://query.wikidata.org/) that lets you write query (in a language called [SPARQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPARQL)) to find items in the database with particular characteristics. If you don't know SPARQL, no worries—there's an interface to help you build your query visually. (Make sure to expand the \"Query Helper\" on the left-hand side.) I used it to create [this query for Wikidata items with a 'genre' of 'Romantic Comedy'](https://query.wikidata.org/#SELECT%20%3Fgenre%20%3Ftitle%20WHERE%20%7B%0A%20%20SERVICE%20wikibase%3Alabel%20%7B%20bd%3AserviceParam%20wikibase%3Alanguage%20%22%5BAUTO_LANGUAGE%5D%2Cen%22.%20%7D%0A%20%20%3Fgenre%20wdt%3AP136%20wd%3AQ860626.%0A%20%20OPTIONAL%20%7B%20%3Fgenre%20wdt%3AP1476%20%3Ftitle.%20%7D%0A%7D). You can probably futz around to get the query to give you a list of your choosing. ([Here's a query for science fiction films, for example.](https://query.wikidata.org/#SELECT%20%3Fgenre%20%3Ftitle%20WHERE%20%7B%0A%20%20SERVICE%20wikibase%3Alabel%20%7B%20bd%3AserviceParam%20wikibase%3Alanguage%20%22%5BAUTO_LANGUAGE%5D%2Cen%22.%20%7D%0A%20%20%3Fgenre%20wdt%3AP136%20wd%3AQ471839.%0A%20%20OPTIONAL%20%7B%20%3Fgenre%20wdt%3AP1476%20%3Ftitle.%20%7D%0A%20%20%0A%20%20%0A%20%20%0A%20%20OPTIONAL%20%7B%20%20%7D%0A%7D)). Use the \"Download\" link near the results preview at the bottom of the page and download to TSV format and put it in the same directory as this notebook. The following cell will read in the titles (make sure to replace `romcoms.tsv` with the name of your TSV file)."
